        Diabetes is a condition that causes high levels of blood sugar
        (Glucose) within the body. This sugar (Glucose) is an important energy
        source for your cells. Too much of sugar in the blood can lead to
        serious health issues. Glucose levels within the body is regulated by
        a hormone called insulin which is regulated by the organ pancreas.
        Diabetes occurs when your body doesn’t use insulin properly or make
        enough insulin. There are two main types of diabetes: type 1 and type
        2. There are no lifestyle changes you can make to lower your risk of
        type 1 diabetes. However, for type 2 diabetes you can manage it
        through healthy eating and regular exercises.

        producing cells within the pancreas

      <h3>Type 2</h3>

        your cells do not react to insulin

      <p>
        Diabetes that occurs mainly during pregnancy. This happens due to high
        levels of sugar in the body during pregnancy and not enough insulin
        levels to regulate it. This kind of diabetes if well monitored and
        controlled will usually be reversible after pregnancy
