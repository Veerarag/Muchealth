      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">What is Ketoacidosis?</b>
        <p>
          When your pancreas produces none or very little amounts of insulin or
          if your pancreas produces sufficient amounts of insulin but your body
          is unable to use it then other hormones are used to burn your body’s
          fat into energy. When this happens it will produce high levels of
          toxic chemicals, including acids and ketone bodies which leads to a
          serious condition called Ketoacidosis
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          What to look out for when you are probably having diabetic ketoacidosis include:
        <ul>
          <li>You become extremely thirsty</li>
          <li>You will urinate very frequently</li>
          <li>You will feel extremely tired and fatigue</li>
          <li>Your breath will have a sweety smell due to the high amount of ketones in
            your blood</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        This is a very serious complication and if left untreated, you may have loss of
        consciousness or even death.

      </div>

      <div class="rounded p-3 bg-white">
        <b class="d-block mb-2">What is Hyperglycaemic Hyperosmolar syndrome (HHS)?</b>
        <p>This is a condition that mainly occurs in type 2 diabetes and it involves very high
          levels of blood glucose levels but not ketones. This is a serious condition in which
          you may experience severe dehydration or loss of consciousness. HHS can also
          be caused by a heart attack, stroke, or infection. When your blood glucose levels
          increase to extremely high levels this will lead to a condition called Gastroparesis
          (a condition where the stomach is unable to completely empty). Due to this you
          may experience symptoms such as:
        <ul>
          <li>You will feel nauseated or may start vomiting</li>
          <li>Your will experience a bloated feeling</li>
          <li>You will feel a burning sensation over your mid chest area (heartburn)</li>

        <b class="d-block mb-2">What happens to your Kidneys?</b>
        <p>
          Having uncontrolled diabetes can put you in risk of kidney failure. This is because
          diabetes will damage and affect the ability of your kidneys to filter waste products
          from your blood. High levels of albumin or protein in your urine may be an early
          sign that your kidneys are not functioning normally. Kidney disease related to
          diabetes is called diabetic nephropathy. This is a condition that does not show
          symptoms earlier but will usually be noticed in later stages of prolonged
          uncontrolled diabetes.

          What Happens to your Blood Circulation?
        </b>
        <p>
          High blood glucose levels will contribute to the formation of fatty deposits within
          the blood vessel walls. With time, these fatty deposits will narrow and eventually
          clog the vessel causing restriction to the blood flow within the vessel and reduced
          blood flow to vital organs in your body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Lack of Blood Flow
        <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';">
          <li>This eventually affect your hands and feet, and cause pain while you’re
            walking. This is condition is called intermittent claudication. Besides this the
            poor blood flow will also increases your risk of developing infections or ulcers
            of the foot. Poor blood flow and nerve damage increases the likelihood of
            having your foot or leg amputated. Therefore, it is critical that you take good
            care of your feet and inspect them often
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          The Narrowing of Blood Vessels
        <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';">
          <li>
            This will cause your feet to have reduced sensation will have reduced
            sensitivity to hot and cold temperatures. This condition is known
            as peripheral neuropathy, which is a type of diabetic neuropathy
            that causes decreased sensation in the extremities. This is particularly
            dangerous because it may prevent you from noticing an injury or infection.

        <b>According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney
          Diseases (NIDDK)</b>, diabetes doubles your risk of heart disease and stroke. In
        addition to monitoring and controlling your blood glucose, healthy eating habits and
        regular exercise can help lower the risk of high blood pressure and high cholesterol
        levels. Smoking increases your risk of cardiovascular problems and restricted blood
        flow.

        <b class="d-block mb-2">What happens to your Skin?</b>
        <p>
          Diabetes can also affect your skin by causing dehydration causing your skin to
          appear dry and soles of the feet to crack. This dehydration is due to the lack of
          moisture when blood sugar levels are high. These affected areas of the skin will
          become susceptible to fungal, bacterial, or yeast infections.
          <br />
          Areas to check regularly? (Look out for any redness, blistering, and itchiness)
        <ol>
          <li>In-between your fingers and toes</li>
          <li>Around your groin area</li>
          <li>Beneath your armpits</li>
          <li>At the corners of your mouth</li>
        </ol>
        High-pressure spots under your foot can lead to calluses. These can become
        infected or develop ulcers. If you do get an ulcer, see a doctor immediately to lower
        the risk of losing your foot. It is important to completely dry your feet after bathing
        or swimming. You can use petroleum jelly or gentle creams, but avoid letting these
        areas become too moist.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also be more prone to:
        <ul>
          <li>Folliculitis (infection of the hair follicles of the skin)</li>
          <li>Styes (boils at the base of your eye lid)</li>
          <li>fungal infection over your nail / nail beds</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Uncontrolled diabetes can also lead to three skin conditions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Eruptive xanthomatosis</b>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';">
              <li>A hard yellow bump with a red ring</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Digital sclerosis</b>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';">
              <li>causes thick skin, most often on the hands or feet</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Diabetic dermopathy</b>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '- ';">
              <li>Causes brown patches on the skin</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        These skin conditions usually clear up when blood sugar gets under control.

        <b class="d-block mb-2">What happens to your Nerves & Vision?</b>
        <p>
          Diabetes causes damage to your nerves which is a condition called diabetic
          neuropathy. This affects your perception of heat, cold, and pain. This condition
          makes you very susceptible to injury because you will not notice and treat injuries
          leading to more severe complications such as ulceration and infections
        </p>
        <p>
          Diabetes can also lead to swollen, leaky blood vessels in your eye, called diabetic
          retinopathy which leads to initial blurring and damaged vision. If not treated this
          will lead to blindness. Therefore, it is very important to screen your vision regularly
          with your doctor if you have diabetes.

          What happens when you are Pregnant?
        </b>
        <p>
          The changing hormones during pregnancy can cause gestational diabetes.
          However, in most cases, gestational diabetes is easily managed, and glucose
          levels usually return to normal after the baby is born. Symptoms are similar to
          other types of diabetes but may also include repeated infections affecting the
          vagina and bladder.
