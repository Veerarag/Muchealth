        <b>What to know about diabetic Retinopathy? NEW LANDING PAGE</b>
        <br />
        <b> Diabetic Retinopathy </b>
        <p>
          Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that occurs due to diabetes.
          It is the leading cause of blindness in adults and one of the main
          reasons for vision loss in adults. If you are diagnosed with diabetes,
          it is important to have a dilated eye exam yearly to look for any
          early signs of vision complications for early treatment.
        </p>
        <b>What to look out for?</b>

      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Short-term blurriness</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Happens when fluid moves in and out of the eye due to uncontrolled
            high sugar levels. This causes the lens to swell leading to blurry
            vision.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Long-term</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Prolonged levels of uncontrolled diabetes will lead to high blood sugar
            levels that damage small blood vessels over time. This damage can lead
            to complications to the retina of the eye which can result in blurry
            vision and eventually blindness.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>When to see a doctor?</b>
        <ol>
          <li>
            If you are experiencing any of the above-mentioned symptoms, consult 
            adoctor immediately
          </li>
          <li>
            Anyone who already has a diabetes diagnosis should go for a routine eye
examination at least once a year. Regular tests can detect any problems 
whilethey are still minor.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Complications of Diabetic Retinopathy?</b>
        <p>
          When blood vessels bleed into the main jelly that fills the eye,this is called
vitreous haemorrhage. Severe cases this will lead to vision loss, as the 
blood in the vitreous blocks light from entering the eye. If the retina 
remains undamaged, bleeding in the vitreous can resolve itself. However, 
when diabetic retinopathy leads to a detached retina this will result in 
severe vision loss due to the scar tissue pulling the retina away from the 
eye causing blindness. A detached retina presents a significant risk of 
total vision loss if a person does not get treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The normal flow of fluid in the eye may become blocked as new blood 
vesselsformation. This blockage causes a build-up of pressure within the 
eye, increasing the risk of nerve damage and vision loss.

          Skin complications from uncontrolled sugar levels are usually the first 
visible sign of diabetes. Proper management of blood sugar levels is 
usually the best way to prevent and treat skin problems that are due to 
diabetes. High levels of blood sugar will cause you to urinate more leading
to dehydration and dry skin.
