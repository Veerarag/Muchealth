      <h2>WHAT LEADS TO AMPUTATION IN DIABETES?</h2>
      <div>
        <b>Why is Amputation Necessary?</b>
        <p>
          Diabetes can cause narrowing and reduced blood flow to your legs and
          feet causing a condition called peripheral arterial disease. This
          condition will also cause nerve damage know as peripheral neuropathy.
          When this happens, you will be void of any kind of pain sensation and
          will not be able to realize any wound or ulcer that is on your feet.
          Over time with continuous pressure on the affected area, it will lead
          to an infection. With the already reduced blood flow, healing of the
          infected area becomes even slower and as a result may not heal. When
          there is persistent infection with no proper healing it will result in
          severe tissue damage or death called gangrene. When the wound has
          undergone substantial damage and is irreparable, amputation may be
          necessary. The most common amputations in people with diabetes are the
          toes, feet, and lower legs.

        <b> Does everyone with diabetes deal with amputation? </b>
        <p>
          With continuous and optimal diabetes management, foot care, and wound
          care, many people with diabetes can limit their risk of amputation or
          prevent it entirely.
